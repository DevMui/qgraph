\title{
Compute the small-worldness index.
}
\description{
Compute the small-worldness index (Humphries \& Gurney, 2008) relying on the global transitity of the network (Newman, 2003).
}
\usage{
smallworldness(x, B = 1000, up = 0.995, lo = 0.005)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A graph. Can be a \code{qgraph} object object, an \code{igraph} object, an adjacency matrix, a weight matrix and an edgelist (possibly weighted).
}
  \item{B}{
The number of random networks.
}
  \item{up}{
The upper quantile.
}
  \item{lo}{
the lower quantile.
}
}
\details{
The function computes the transitivity of the target network (\code{trans_target}) and the average shortest path length (\code{avlength_target}). Then it computes the average of the same indices on B random networks (\code{mean_trans_random} and \code{mean_avlength_rnd}). The small-worldness is then computed as \code{(clusttrg/clustrnd_m)/(lengthtrg/lengthrnd_m)}. The  \code{lo} and \code{up} quantiles of the distribution of the random networks are also returned for both the transitivity and the average shortest path length.

A network can be said "smallworld" if \code{smallworldness} is higher than one (a stricter rule is \code{smallworldness}>=3; Humphries & Gurney, 2008). To consider a network as "smallworld", it is also suggested to inspect that the network has a transitivity substantially higher than comparable random networks (i.e., \code{trans_target} >> \code{mean_trans_random}) and that the average shortest path length is similar or higher than that computed on random networks (i.e., \code{avlength_target} >= \code{mean_avlength_rnd}).
Edge weights, signs and directions are ignored in the computation of the indices.

If a directed network is given as input, an edge between every two nodes i and j is considered present if there is an arrow either from i to j or from j to i.
